<script>


var item = null; 



document.write(item) // outputs null

document.write(typeof item) // This outputs object. You've just discovered one of the many quirks of the Javascript language. Typeof when being used on null values outputs object.
// This is not what should happen but like all programming languages, it has its faults.
