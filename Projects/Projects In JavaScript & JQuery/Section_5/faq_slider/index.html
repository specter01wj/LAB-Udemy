				<li class="q"><img src="arrow.png"> What happens when an author signs the IEEE Copyright Form?</li>
				<li class="a">When an author signs the IEEE Copyright Form, he/she is transferring ownership of the copyright rights in the work to the IEEE. In other words, the IEEE becomes owner of the paper when the author signs, dates and submits a corresponding IEEE Copyright Form. </li>
				
				<li class="q"><img src="arrow.png"> Does IEEE consider authors posting their papers on preprint servers or on their companies' web sites to be a form of prior publication, which may then disqualify the papers from further editorial consideration?</li>
				<li class="a">No. IEEE policy allows authors to submit previously posted papers to IEEE publications for consideration as long as authors are able to transfer copyright to IEEE, i.e., they had not transferred copyright to another party prior to submission.</li>
				
				<li class="q"><img src="arrow.png"> What is a Trademark? </li>
				<li class="a">A trademark is a name, title or graphic design intended to identify an entity or product. When a trademark is registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, broadly exclusive rights are obtained by the owner. </li>
				
				<li class="q"><img src="arrow.png"> What is the difference between copyright and trademark? </li>
				<li class="a">Copyright rights protect the particular expression of an idea, not the idea itself.<br>Trademark and service mark refer to rights meant to protect a name, title or logo or other identifier of an entity or product.<br>Where copyright rights are nearly exclusive, trademark laws grant fully exclusive rights to the owner. </li>
				
				<li class="q"><img src="arrow.png"> What is the difference between copyright infringement and plagiarism? </li>
				<li class="a">Infringement occurs when an author's work is reused without the author's approval/permission, even though full author attribution might have accompanied the reuse.<br>Plagiarism occurs when an author's work has been reused in such a way as to make it appear as someone else's work. </li>
				
				<li class="q"><img src="arrow.png"> What should be done when a charge of plagiarism is brought against an author? </li>
				<li class="a">Plagiarism is a serious breach of professional conduct, with potentially severe ethical and legal consequences. Therefore, IEEE and its constituent bodies strongly condemn such misconduct and shall vigorously investigate all allegations of plagiarism involving IEEE authors and/or IEEE publications.<br>In the event an author or publisher brings a charge of plagiarism against an IEEE author or an IEEE publication, the Editor-in-Chief (EIC) of the sponsoring entity's publication should become the primary authority to initiate, conduct and finalize a review of the charge. </li>
