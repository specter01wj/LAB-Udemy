# Organic Shop

This project demonstrates a simple e-commerce application for an imaginary organic shop. It is built with Angular, Firebase and Bootstrap 4 as the final project in my complete Angular course: 

http://programmingwithmosh.com/courses/complete-angular-master-class/

In this course, you'll see how I've built this application, step-by-step.

By the end of watching course, you'll be able to:

- Use Angular and Firebase to build real-time serverless applications
- Think like a software engineer 
- Write clean and testable code 
- Refactor bad code into good code 
- Design classes and modules with proper boundaries 


## Important 

Before running this application on your machine, create a Firebase project. You need to replace the Firebase settings I've defined in /src/environments with the settings of your own Firebase project.

## Running the Application

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
