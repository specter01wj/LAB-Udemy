        // using the for statement, call the calculateInterest method with
        // the amount of 10000 with an interestRate of 2,3,4,5,6,7, and 8
        // and print the results to the console window.

        // How would you modify the for loop above to do the same thing as
        // shown but to start from 8% and work back to 2%

    // Create a for statement using any range of numbers
    // Determine if the number is a prime number using the isPrime method
    // if it is a prime number, print it out AND increment a count of the
    // number of prime numbers found
    // if that count is 3 exit the for loop
    // hint:  Use the break; statement to exit
